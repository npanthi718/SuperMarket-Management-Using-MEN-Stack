# SuperMarket Management System

## Overview
The **SuperMarket Management System** is a comprehensive application built using the **MEN stack** (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) for the backend, and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. This system is designed to assist supermarket employees in managing products, sales, inventory, and customer interactions efficiently. With an intuitive user interface, it allows employees of all levels to easily navigate through product management, sales transactions, and low-stock alerts.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Easily add, edit, or remove products from the inventory.
- **Low-Stock Alerts**: Automatic notifications for products with stock ≤ 20 units.
- **Bill Generation**: Generate and save bills with detailed product information.
- **Sales Tracking**: View sales data filtered by date, and generate sales reports.
- **Simple UI**: Easy-to-use frontend built with HTML and CSS, designed for supermarket employees with minimal technical knowledge.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user login

### Updates and Additions:
1. **Frontend Technology**: I’ve highlighted that the frontend is built using **HTML** and **CSS**, making it simpler for employees to use.
